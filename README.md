# DemoWebShop Automation Testing Project
This is a personal test automation project built to demonstrate my skills in testing a sample e-commerce application – Demo Web Shop. The project covers both positive and negative test cases using a modular, scalable, and maintainable structure.

## 🔍 Features

- Positive & negative E2E tests (e.g., registration, purchase)
- Retry mechanism for flaky test recovery
- Clean architecture using Page Object Model
- Field validation tests (e.g., empty fields, invalid inputs)
- Rich reporting with ExtentReports
- Easy to maintain and extend for new test cases
- Base classes, helper methods, utilities for reusability

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java 23
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG
- Maven
- Log4j
- ExtentReports
- Apache POI (for Excel test data)
- Custom RetryAnalyzer
- Page Object Model
- Custom utilities and BaseTest

### Personal Note
This project represents my understanding of real-world test automation structure. It’s far from final – I’ll keep improving it as I grow.
